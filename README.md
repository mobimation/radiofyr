# radiofyr
A Bluetooth Low Energy endeavor where chinese BLE beacons communicate with a swedish mobile app.

This implements a swedish language configuration app that enable convenient programming of
beacon identity of devices to be deployed in the field.  The existing chinese app contained a lot of
chinese text that made it unusable for deploying to Swedish customers so a swedish one was needed.
This is developed for "AprilBrother" iBeacon modules and uses its Android API for configuration access.

go about deploying radiofyr beacons to the world.
